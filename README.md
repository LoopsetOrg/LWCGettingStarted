# Getting Started with LWC

This is a sample application that demonstrates how to get started building applications with Lightning web components and SFDX tools. It centers around creating a solution for a fictional outdoor provider named Carved Rock Fitness. 
The solution is designed to use Lightning web components and allow a mobile or desktop user to search for products.
